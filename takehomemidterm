Notes on Citing Sources (Group #2):

You may find the workd, "Crouton!" written across the margins of your paper. 
We don't like them in papers, but we do like them in salads.

If you see Crouton, Kim Knight was reading along and found something really jarring. No context, no analysis.
Over-relying on the source to make an argument. Question arises, when to quote vs. when to paraphrase?

Why should you paraphrase? Sounds like you. Flows with the message and argument.

When should you quote? 
If the idea or statement is unique or specific that you lose something when paraphasing, then you should quote. 
You can not say it any better.
Example: "The medium is the message"

You do not want to let the quotes, do the work for you. You have to explain how the quote is relevant to your argument. 
Do not assume the reader understands, it should support your ideas, not have the paper rely on the quote.

Goals: Paraphrase when possible, Contextualize, Analyze
