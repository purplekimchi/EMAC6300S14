Global organization vs paragraph organization

Paragraphs should contain one topic, often through the first sentence called the Topic Sentence.
Know what your Topic Sentences are.

Between paragraphs there should be a transition. We can make transitions either through the last sentence of the paragraph
or through the first sentence of the new paragraph.

Paragraphs should be distinguished in order to create an arguement.
