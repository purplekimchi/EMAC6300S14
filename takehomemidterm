Midterm Revision Notes
(I was given the "use of sources" notes assignment, but I wanted to take notes on everything.)
My assignment: TWO
THESIS
Roadmap : argument
Example: Cats > dogs
    -smaller
    -go to the bathroom in one place
    -lower maintenance
Something that isn't arguable : not a thesis!
    -Dogs and cats are both animals.
Blue highlight in our papers is what Kim thinks is our thesis

ORGANIZATION
Paragraph:
    -one topic
    -topic sentence
    -evidence
    -transitions in-between
        -can be at the end of the paragraph or beginning of the next
        -meant to use when changing topics

USE OF SOURCES
"Crouton!" - your paper is a salad and a crouton takes you by surprise (it doesn't flow.)
Example:
    "The ball is red" (Whalen 37). The rest of your paper...
    -It's random and isn't explained. don't rely on the source to make the argument for you.
Paraphrase instead of quote if the writing style doesn't flow with your style. Paraphrase most of the time!
    -According to...
    -use full title the first time and explain the source's importance
Quote if it can't be said any better than the way they've said it.
    -Example: "The medium is the message." - McLuhan
After a quote or paraphrase, connect it to your argument.
Overview of use of sources:
    -paraphrase when possible
    -contextualize
    -analyze
