Notes on using sources
    * Crouton!
        * in papers we don't like crutons because they are different
        * something jarring in the paper that did not fit
        * quotes don't have context or analysis
        * possibly over relying on quote
    * When to quote vs. When to paraphrase
        * most of the time we should paraphrase
        * You should quote if the langauge is so specific that you would loose something by paraphrasing
        * ex. would quote McCluhan "The Medium is the Message."
        * say the name of author and who they are for a little bit of context.
    * If you do quote
        * Write an introductory sentence
        * don't let the quote do the work for you
        * after quote must explain how it is relevent to your argument
        * use quote to support ideas, not rely on it
